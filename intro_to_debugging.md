1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
    The program will run until it hits a breakpoint, where it will pause and then launch the debugger console

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
    No

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
    Use step over

4. What does the step into command do?
    Runs the line that it is stopped on and takes you into any methods that exist on that line

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
    Evaluate expression only lets you enter one expression (or method on whatever you want to check in the code). Evaluate code fragment lets you run multiple lines of code and also add variables. Code fragments need to follow the full rules of Java with semicolons, an expression doesn't need to have a semicolon at the end.
